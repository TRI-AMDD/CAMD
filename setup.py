LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
camd is software designed to support Computational Autonomy for Materials Discovery
based on ongoing work led by the
[Toyota Research Institute](http://www.tri.global/accelerated-materials-design-and-discovery/).

camd enables the construction of sequential learning pipelines using a set of
abstractions that include
* Agents - decision making entities which select experiments to run from pre-determined
    candidate sets
* Experiments - experimental procedures which augment candidate data in a way that
    facilitates further experiment selection
* Analyzers - Post-processing procedures which frame experimental results in the context
    of candidate or seed datasets

In addition to these abstractions, camd provides a loop construct which executes
the sequence of hypothesize-experiment-analyze by the Agent, Experiment, and Analyzer,
respectively.  Simulations of agent performance can also be conducted using
after the fact sampling of known data.
